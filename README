MobDebug is a remote debugger for Lua.

MobDebug lets you control the execution of another Lua program remotely, 
setting breakpoints and inspecting the current state of the program. 

MobDebug is based on RemDebug (http://www.keplerproject.org/remdebug/) and 
extends it in several ways:

1. fixed several existing bugs
2. added new commands: LOAD, RELOAD, OUT
3. added support for MoSync clients (http://mosync.com/)
4. tested integration with Estrela editor (http://www.luxinia.de/index.php/Estrela/)
5. removed dependency on LuaFileSystem

INSTALLATION

Make src/mobdebug.lua available to your script. 
See examples/README and examples/*.lua for examples of how to use the module.

DEPENDENCIES

MobDebug depends on LuaSocket 2.0 and has been tested with Lua 5.1.

HISTORY 

Dec 02 2011 v0.40
  - First public release.

Dec 17 2011 v0.41
  - Added slash conversion in filenames to make breakpoints work regardless
    of how slashes are specified in file names and in setb/delb commands.
  - Added tests with breakpoints in files in subfolders.
  - Added optimization for filename processing in the debug hook 
    (Christoph Kubisch).
  - Added conversion of newlines for EVAL/EXEC commands to make them work
    with multiline expressions.
  - Allowed 'setb' and 'delb' commands to accept '-' as the filename.
    The last referenced (checked/stopped at/etc.) filename is used.

Dec 30 2011 v0.42
  - Added support for debugging of wxwidgets applications.
  - Added ability to break an application being debugged; this requires 
    socket.select and async processing (doesn't work from the command line).

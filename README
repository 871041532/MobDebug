MobDebug is a remote debugger for Lua.

MobDebug lets you control the execution of another Lua program remotely, 
setting breakpoints and inspecting the current state of the program. 

MobDebug is based on RemDebug (http://www.keplerproject.org/remdebug/) and 
extends it in several ways:

1. fixed several existing bugs
2. added new commands: LOAD, RELOAD, OUT
3. added support for MoSync clients (http://mosync.com/)
4. tested integration with Estrela editor (http://www.luxinia.de/index.php/Estrela/)
5. removed dependency on LuaFileSystem

INSTALLATION

Make src/mobdebug.lua available to your script. 
See examples/README and examples/*.lua for examples of how to use the module.

DEPENDENCIES

MobDebug depends on LuaSocket 2.0 and has been tested with Lua 5.1.
